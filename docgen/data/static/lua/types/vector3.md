# vector3

Vector3 data type is usually used for coordinates, it stores x, y and z as numbers with decimals.

```lua
vector3(x --[[ number ]], y --[[ number ]], z --[[ number ]])
```

## Create a vector3

```lua
local vec = vector3(0.0, 1.0, 2.0)
```

## Get distance between two vectors

```lua
#(vector3(10.0, 20.0, 30.0) - vector3(1.0, 2.0, 3.0))
```

## Add up two vectors

It will add up second x to first x, second y to first y, second z to first z.

```lua
local vec = vector3(10.0, 20.0, 30.0) + vector3(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)
```

## Substract two vectors

It will substract second x from first x, second y from first y, second z from first z.

```lua
local vec = vector3(10.0, 20.0, 30.0) - vector3(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)
```

## You can also check if they're equal

```lua
if vector3(1.0, 2.0, 3.0) == vector3(1.0, 2.0, 3.0) then
    print("Same vector")
end
```

## Also you can print them

```lua
print(vector3(1.0, 2.0, 3.0))
```

## Get the vector as a string

```lua
local vecstring = tostring(vector3(1.0, 2.0, 3.0))
```
